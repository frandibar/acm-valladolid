</p><h2><font color="#0070e8"><a name="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</a></font></h2>
<p>The input will contain several test cases. First line of the input is the an
integer which indicate the number of test case followed by a blank line.&nbsp;Each
consecutive test case will also separated by a blank line.</p>
<p>
Each test case gets 25 cards, 5 cards per line. Each card consists
 of two characters. The first represents the rank of the card: `A', `2',
     `3', `4', `5', `6', `7', `8', `9', `X', `J', `Q', `K'.
     The second represents the suit of the card: `S', `H', `D', `C'.
</p><p>
</p><p>
     The cards are dealt into a  <img alt="tex2html_wrap_inline44" src="451_files/451img1.gif" align="middle" height="24" width="37">  square.  Each row and column is
     evaluated to determine the highest hand type for which its 5 cards
     qualify.  The hand types, from low to high, are Nothing, Pair, Two
     Pair, Three of a Kind, Straight, Flush, Full House, Four of a Kind,
     Straight Flush.  A hand qualifies only once, and then only for its
     highest type.  For example, a Four of a Kind does not count as two
     pair or three of a kind.

</p><h2><font color="#0070e8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Output</a></font></h2>
<p>
For each test case output a list of 9 integers, telling how many hands of each handtype were found.
from lowest to highest, being:
</p><p>
</p><ol><li> <b>Nothing</b>: does not qualify as any of the following. Example: AC,
          3H, QS, JD, 7D.
<p>
</p></li><li> <b>One Pair</b>: contains two cards of the same rank and does not
          qualify for any of the following. Example: 2C, 3H, 4H, 2H, KD.
<p>
</p></li><li> <b>Two Pair</b>: contains two cards of one rank and two cards of another and does not qualify for any of the following. Example: 2C,
          3H, 4H, 2H, 4D.
<p>
</p></li><li> <b>Three of a Kind</b>: contains three cards of the same rank and does
          not qualify for any of the following. Example: QS, KH, 2C, QD,
          QC.
<p>
</p></li><li> <b>Straight</b>: the five cards of the hand may be sorted on rank so that an unbroken sequence of 5 ranks is formed and the hand does not
          qualify for any of the following. 
There can be cycle through Ace. That is AC, 2H, 4D, 3H, 5S forms a straight, as
does JH, XD,QC, KD, AS and QC, KD, AS, 2H, 3D.
<p>
</p></li><li> <b>Flush</b>: the five cards are all of the same suit and the hand does
          not qualify for any of the following. Example: 5D, AD, KD, 7D,
          QD.
<p>
</p></li><li> <b>Full House</b>: the hand contains three cards of one rank and two
          cards of another. Example: 3C, QS, QD, 3H, 3S.
<p>
</p></li><li> <b>Four of a kind</b>: the hand contains four cards of the same rank.
          Example: AS, AD, AH, 7C, AC.
<p>
</p></li><li> <b>Straight Flush</b>: the hand meets the criteria for being both a
          straight and a flush.
