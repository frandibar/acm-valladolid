It seems there is a lot of guessing going on about the input format.
Whether there is extra spaces before, after and within author names.
There is nothing like that. Input is precisely like that of sample


The Judge input is correct except that there are person names with no initials!
These persons always appear at the end of the list of authors and can be ignored. 
For example:
Smith, M.N., Chen, X., Johnson: Introduction to Algorithms
>> Ignore Johnson in this case.

Smith, M.N., Chen, X., Johnson, I.R.: Introduction to Algorithms
>> Don't ignore Johnson, I.R.


I was assuming that the first char of the author's name was always upper case.
Apparently it can be upper, lower or can even be any other char...
